# PilatusPowderSpatial
Jupyter notebooks fitting Pilatus2m detector module geometry, edited from Jon Wright's notebook using Eiger4m.
I've added an algorithm for finding gaps and generating the offset and module size variables. It also removes 
a lot of Eiger4m specific hard coding from the original so should be easier to use with other detectors.
